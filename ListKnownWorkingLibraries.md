One of the main troubles in installing Hooke is getting the dependencies right. There are a lot of possible version combinations and often a given version of a library could play less than well with others. So, here is a list of known setups that work with latest Hooke version.

If you have a different but working combination, you can post it! Use the **version** command of Hooke to gather your library combination.

Note that the operating system (OS) is -to our knowledge- largely irrelevant: what should really matter are the Python and libraries' versions.
