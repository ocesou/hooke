#summary File format support
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Requirements

We need full support for most force spectroscopy data files. Please help us by:
  * giving us example data files
  * giving us specifications of data files
  * testing code and reporting bugs

= Supported file formats =

  * *Veeco Picoforce (6.12)*
    drivers: picoforce.py ; picoforcealt.py (depends on your version of Picoforce)
    
    Support for 6.13 and above is possibly faulty (see [http://code.google.com/p/hooke/issues/detail?id=10 bug 0010] )


  * *JPK* (experimental support; needs testing!) (old versions)
    drivers: jpk.py

  * *MFP 1D* (indirect) (needs testing)
    drivers: mfp1dexport.py
    Still _indirect_ support, requires Igor export scripts provided by Rolf Schmidt et al. available in the subversion reporsitory. See Mfp1dSupport for the details.

  * *MFP 3D* (needs testing!)
    These files are now directly supported by the mfp3d driver. Note that "flatten" manipulator usually distorts the curve, it is recommended to deactivate it `set flatten 0` 
    The old way of importing MFP3D data [http://code.google.com/p/hooke/wiki/HDF5 HDF5] is not recommended any more.

  * Simple *comma-separated values*
    drivers: csv.py
    Basically little more than a proof of concept, but one can build useful drivers on top of it.

= To do file formats =

  * Asylum MFP 1D
  * Anything else...
